# DarkAge Mod for Minetest

Original mod by Master Gollum
Modified by addi.

Contains code from CragiDavi and HybridDog

## Introduction

  This mod adds a few new blocks that allows to create new buildings in a
  pre industrial landscape. Of course, feel free to use them in any other
  construction :P

  It also provides more layers of stones. I tried not to turn mining in
  a rainbow, so don't expect to find them easily. There are two kinds of
  materials, stones, that spawns in layers at different deep and clay
  like materials (silt and mud) that you will find in water places.
  Silt and Mud are more easy to find than stone layers, but if you find
  one it will be a real mine, with all probability with hundreds of blocks.

  I used mainly 4 square recipes to avoid collisions with other MODs,
  anyway I have not checked all them, so it is possible that another
  person is already using one or more of this combinations.

  I also used Desert Sand and Desert Stone, because they almost are not
  used in the default version. Probably I will change this recipes in
  next releases.
